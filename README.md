# Vehicle Detection Using Classical Computer Vision

A computer vision pipeline that identifies and tracks vehicles in dashcam footage using traditional machine learning techniques. This project blends feature engineering, sliding window detection, and heatmap-based filtering to build a functional car detector‚Äîno deep learning involved!

## Project Summary

This project demonstrates a vehicle detection pipeline using handcrafted image features (HOG, color histograms, spatial binning) and a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. It's designed to process road video footage and annotate vehicles in real time.

This is a modern implementation of classic vision techniques, built to better understand the foundations of autonomous vehicle perception systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hareeshrp/vehicle-vision.git
   cd vehicle-detection-classical-cv
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `project.ipynb`:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Run all cells sequentially to:
   - Extract features
   - Train the vehicle classifier
   - Process the video for car detection
